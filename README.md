Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design pattern that is commonly used in software development to increase the flexibility, modularity, and maintainability of an application. In the context of Spring Boot, IoC is implemented through the use of the Spring Framework's Dependency Injection (DI) feature.

In DI, the responsibility of creating and managing object dependencies is shifted from the application code to the Spring container. The container is responsible for creating and configuring objects, injecting dependencies, and managing their lifecycle.

This allows the application code to be more modular and flexible, as it is no longer tightly coupled to specific implementations of its dependencies. Instead, the dependencies can be easily swapped out or modified by configuring the Spring container.

In Spring Boot, IoC is used extensively throughout the framework. For example, when you annotate a class with @Component, Spring Boot will automatically register the class with the container and manage its dependencies.

Overall, IoC is a powerful tool for building flexible, modular, and maintainable applications, and is a key feature of Spring Boot.
